      Since the new WebDriver W3C standard isn't fully implemented across all browsers today, Taiko uses the next best thing: the Chrome DevTools Protocol.       
            </p>
            <p>
As you might've guessed from the name, this is the same stable low-level protocol that the Chrome Developer Tools use to interact with the browser, like the JavaScript console. If you've ever run a Lighthouse Audit on your website, Lighthouse uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol to pull performance metrics and accessibility results to build out its detailed analytics reports.  
            </p>
            <p>
Taiko has access to all of the same data and browser automation capabilities that these familiar development tools have. And now you do, too, in an easy scriptable environment.
