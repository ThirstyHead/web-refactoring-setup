      What makes Taiko so stable is that it ships with a known-good, compatible, working release of Chromium when you 'npm install' it.       
            </p>

            <p>
And what is Chromium? Well, outside of software, it's the element used to make the chrome features on your car. In the web development world, it's the free and open source core that Google uses to make their Chrome browser. (Clever, eh?)
            </p>

            <p>
But Chromium is also at the core of the Opera browser. And in a recent, unexpected move, Microsoft abandoned nearly 30 years of building their own web technologies to make Chromium the core of their Microsoft Edge browser.
            </p>

            <p>
So while there are still healthy competitors to Chromium in the open source ecosystem -- Firefox uses a core called Gecko, and Apple's Safari uses a core called WebKit -- Chromium is a popular, well-supported foundation to many popular web browsers that you and your users are most likely already using.
