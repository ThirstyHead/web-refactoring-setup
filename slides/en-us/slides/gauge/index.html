            Today, I'd like to talk to you about Gauge, a free and open source testing framework for acceptance testing.
            </p>
            <p>But before we get too far, I think that it's worthwhile to define some terms more clearly. You'll hear me call acceptance testing "User Journey testing", which I think is a better description of what we're trying to accomplish when we use Gauge. Either way, this kind of testing is significantly different than the kind of testing that you probably do today, if you're a typical front-end developer.</p>
