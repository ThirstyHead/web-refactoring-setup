$ taiko


Version: 0.5.0 (Chromium:73.0.3638.0)
Type .api for help and .exit to quit

      If you've already installed Taiko, you can simply type 'taiko' at the command prompt. This will launch you into the interactive REPL where you can explore the features of Taiko at your own pace.      
            </p>

            <p>
At this point, you are given two suggestions to type. One of these suggestions will make this a very short discussion. Why don't you type '.api' instead and see what other commands are available to you?
