            <p>User Journey tests are written in the language of the end user, not in the language of the developer (either programming or spoken). Users typically say things like, "I'd like to add tomatoes to my shopping cart", not "I'd like to add the UPC string of the selected item to that array of strings over there in the Cart component."
            </p>
            <p>Now, while literal-minded developers might scoff and think, "Meh, as long as the functionality gets tested, does the language of the test really matter?"</p>
            <p>Here's the deal: it does. It really does, especially when we're talking about User Journey tests. You can call them "acceptance" tests, because what we're trying to figure out is what an "acceptable" website looks like to the user -- Is it acceptable if you can't add items to a cart? Is it acceptable if you can't check out and actually purchase the items?</p>
            <p>So by calling these tests User Journey tests, it brings the user back into forefront the conversation. The tests are written in the user's language. The acceptance of the finished project is ultimately up to the user, not the developer.</p>
